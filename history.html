                    <h3>HISTORY OF THE CHURCH</h3>
                    <h4>GLORY IMPACT APOSTOLIC GLOBAL MINISTRY</h4>
                    
                    <p>Pastor (Dr.) John Adebowale Adeyemi, an Apostolic and Prophetic Pastor and teacher, a copious writer, distinguished author, public speaker, spiritual leader and researcher was born in January 3rd, 1971.</p>
                    
                    <p>God drew him (Pastor John Debo) from obscure and low beginnings and conferred on him that most honourable office of herald and minister of the Gospel.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the backing of the scripture – John 15:16. "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, He will give it to you". (KJV).</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544027993-37dbfe43562a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80" alt="Bible School" class="history-image-left">
                    
                    <p>"This ministry (Glory Impact Apostolic Global Ministry) was given birth to by the Holy Spirit after a series of fasting and prayers when I was in Bible school at Christ Apostolic Church Theological Seminary (an affiliate of University of Ibadan) Ile-Ife".</p>
                    
                    <p>After his Theological education, Pastor Debo had no intentions of starting a ministry, but the Lord spoke to him in a clear revelation in 1992.</p>
                    
                    <p>He said "I have called you to preach and judge sin the life of my people and to prepare them for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ".</p>
                    
                    <p>The Lord gave him the name of this ministry then as THE GLORY OF HIS COMING EVANGELICAL MISSION. When he woke up from his trance, Pastor Debo narrated the vision to his friend and prayer partner and they prayed about it together: Not quite long, a colleague of his in the seminary called him (Pastor John Debo) and confirmed what the Lord had told him.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618666-fcd25c85cd64?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80" alt="Church Service" class="history-image-right">
                    
                    <p>But Pastor John Debo had plans of his own. He decided to join the work force and ministers of his main church (Christ Apostolic Church) where he was born and raised. He worked and served the church faithfully in various capacities in towns and villages (ranging from the post of Teacher, Evangelist, Pastor, Youth co-ordinator etc. for the period of fourteen (15) years.</p>
                    
                    <p>The urge and signals to go out of his denominational church (C.A.C) began in 2002 but he still believed that he could do what God had called him for within his denomination.</p>
                    
                    <p>The true Apostle lives and works for the heart of God to be manifested throughout the world. And when we ask ourselves – what is the heart of God all about? – Just one word tells it all: PEOPLE. The Gospel was given to take care of the needs of humanity, of which salvation is a part.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511795409834-ef04bbd61622?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80" alt="Prayer Meeting" class="history-image-left">
                    
                    <p>People who are hurting don't care about your money, what they seek for is the relief that only an anointed spirit led person can give. Money is just a tool that will facilitate it. Money finances the tools that bring salvation, deliverance, healing and discipleship. Money is a tool to get the job done in the area He has called you to.</p>
                    
                    <p>God spoke and sent several ministers to Pastor John Debo that the time had come for him to start the ministry He committed into his hands. Among the ministers who were sent to him were Prophet Adeosun of Christian Praying Ministry at Itori, Ogun State and his father in the Lord and mentor, Apostle Wole Oladiyun of Christ Living spring Apostolic Ministry (CLAM) Omole, Lagos. But Pastor John Debo built a barrier of resistance until God thrust him into the game.</p>
                    
                    <p>He allowed the sovereign hand of God to work in his life as one whose heart is totally committed to Him. We may have our own plans but God ultimately set the course.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529107386315-e1a2ed48a78e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80" alt="First Service" class="history-image-right">
                    
                    <p>Obedience is what God is looking for and what he expects from our lives. When we are obedient to what He asks of us, then His desire fuses into our own. Obedience produces a submitted life, a submitted life that says "God, this is all about you; it's not about me".</p>
                    
                    <p>Pastor John Debo then went to community located at Itako – Olowofela, a town of Obafemi Owode Local Government Area in Ogun State situated at Magboro via Ibafo, along Lagos/Ibadan express road on the 4th of January 2010 to start a week long Evangelical Crusade and the 1st Sunday service was held on the 10th of January 2010.</p>
                    
                    <p>The church started in his sitting room with about 10 people in attendance, after which the church grew within few years and became the leading voice in the community. Pastor John Debo coordinates other ministry and churches in the community together called Joint Christian Minister Fellowship; they hold a monthly prayer meeting and an annual prayer day for the land tagged Olowofela Day.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544027993-37dbfe43562a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80" alt="Community Ministry" class="history-image-left">
                    
                    <p>As we knew that God is dynamic and His revelation is progressive, in 1999 God told Pastor John Debo the need to change the name of the church and location. This was confirmed by his father in the Lord Pastor Wole Oladiyun and in obedience to this the church was renamed GLORY IMPACT APOSTOLIC MINISTRY in 2020. And the church moved to Lagos and was inaugurated by Pastor Wole Oladiyun in July 22, 2021. Since then God has been faithful moving the church from glory to glory in Jesus name.</p>
